Configurando contas de A a Z

 *Accounts must be configured to meet your company's needs.
 This chapter explains how to modify your chart of accounts, journals, access rights, initial
 account balances and default values for the initial configuration of your OpenERP accounts.*

Assuming that it calculates sufficiently accurately, the best accounting software would be marked out by
its usability and simplicity of data entry, and flexibility in configuring its different components.
You would be able to easily modify the accounting module to meet your own needs, so that you could
optimize it for the way you want to use it.

OpenERP lets you adapt and reconfigure many functions to ease the task of data entry:

* adding controls for data entry,

* customizing the screens,

* filling fields automatically during data entry with data that is already known to the system.

For this chapter, you should start with a fresh database that includes demo data,
with :mod:`sale` and its dependencies installed, and no particular chart of accounts configured.
